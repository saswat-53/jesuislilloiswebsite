        title: "This Project",
        p1: "As a dedicated francophile, I fell deeply in love with French history, culture, art, and literature while learning the language during my business school days. Every French city and village has its own hidden stories — exploring them feels like an exciting treasure hunt through time.",
        p2: "Lille, however, stands out as much more than a small town. Including its wider metropolitan area, it ranks as France’s fourth-largest urban region (after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille). Its strategic location has made it a key player in European history since the 12th century, leaving behind layers of rich memories waiting to be uncovered.",
        p3: "Drawing from local bookstores, archives, historians, documentaries, and countless walks, I gathered these stories and turned my passion into a curated collection of unique expeditions — perfect for fellow francophiles, curious travelers, and anyone eager to discover Lille like a local."
      },
      mission2: {
        title: "What do I do today with this project?",
        p1: "I left Lille in 2025 after calling it home for five wonderful years. Following my graduation from EDHEC in 2023, I chose to stay as an entrepreneur — I already felt deeply connected to the city after three years as a student. During that time, I got involved in local politics as a young activist, working to protect and celebrate Lille’s rich heritage.",
        p2: "Je Suis Lillois” started as a pure passion project, never my main professional focus, but I poured my heart and soul into it. That’s why the website is still here, why I keep writing blog posts, and why people continue to discover these stories.Right now, I’m not running expeditions or taking bookings — but the door is never fully closed. If there’s enough interest from fellow francophiles or if someone wants to help bring these tours back to life, I’d happily restart them.",
        p3: "My dream remains the same: one day, to own a little place in Lille and return often. When I left, I left a small piece of my heart in its streets. So if you ever feel a quiet spark of wonder while wandering Vieux-Lille or along the canals… know that a bit of this Lillois heart might still be there, waiting."
